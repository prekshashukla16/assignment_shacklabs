Problem statement: The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these
variables affect the house price.
Using more than one model, predict the price of the house using the given dataset. Please compare the
accuracy of the models along with the drawbacks of each technique's assumptions before recommending
the final prediction model.

Problem statement:
Using ML/DL techniques, match similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once
similar products are matched, display the retail price from FK and AMZ side by side. Please explore as
many techniques as possible before choosing the final technique.
You may either display the final result in single table format OR You may create a simple form where we
input the product name and the output of prices of the product from both websites are displayed.
For example:
FDT Women's Leggings from Flipkart should be matched with FDT WOMEN'S Leggings Pants from
Amazon
Once we input the product details, the output should be as follows:
Product name in Flipkart
Retail Price in
Flipkart
Discounted Price in
Flipkart
Product name in Amazon
Retail Price in
Amazon
Discounted Price in Amazon
FDT Women's Leggings 699 309 FDT WOMEN'S Leggings Pants 698 362
Guidelines:
1. Please write modular, reusable, extensible & scalable code using best coding practices
2. Share your code, output file and readme files on GitHub publicly, to make sure we can review it
3. Mention all your assumptions and the rationale behind them
4. Please add comments and descriptions where applicable
